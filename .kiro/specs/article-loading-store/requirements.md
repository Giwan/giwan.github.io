# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a reactive article loading system using nano stores to manage article state. When users request more articles, the nano store will be updated with new articles, which will be rendered reactively without requiring a full page reload. This will improve the user experience by making article loading more seamless and efficient.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want articles to load dynamically when I request more content, so that I can browse content without page refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initially loads the blog page THEN the system SHALL load an initial set of articles and store them in a nano store
2. WHEN a user requests more articles THEN the system SHALL fetch additional articles and add them to the existing nano store
3. WHEN the nano store is updated with new articles THEN the UI SHALL reactively update to display the new articles
4. WHEN articles are being loaded THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
5. IF there is a network error during article loading THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the article loading system to be efficient with network resources, so that the website performs well even on slower connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN articles are loaded THEN the system SHALL only request articles that haven't been loaded yet
2. WHEN the user navigates away from the blog page and returns THEN the system SHALL preserve the previously loaded articles in the store
3. IF the user has reached the end of available articles THEN the system removes the "load more" button
4. WHEN articles are stored in the nano store THEN the system SHALL maintain proper pagination information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the article loading system to be well-integrated with the existing Astro and React components, so that it's maintainable and follows project patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the nano store THEN the system SHALL follow the existing project structure and patterns
2. WHEN the nano store is updated THEN any React components that depend on the article data SHALL re-render appropriately
3. WHEN implementing the article loading system THEN it SHALL be compatible with both client-side navigation and direct URL access
4. WHEN implementing the article store THEN the system SHALL maintain proper TypeScript typing for article data
