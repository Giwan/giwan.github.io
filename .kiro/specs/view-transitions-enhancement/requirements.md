# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current view transition implementation in the Astro blog site provides basic page transitions but lacks polish and comprehensive coverage. Users experience jarring transitions between pages, inconsistent animation timing, and missing transitions for key UI elements. This feature will enhance the view transition system to provide smooth, contextual animations that improve the overall user experience and create a more app-like feel for the website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want smooth and contextually appropriate transitions between pages, so that navigation feels fluid and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between any two pages THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth transition animation
2. WHEN navigating forward through the site THEN the system SHALL use forward-direction animations (slide-in from right)
3. WHEN navigating backward through the site THEN the system SHALL use backward-direction animations (slide-in from left)
4. WHEN transitioning between different page types (blog to tools, home to about) THEN the system SHALL use appropriate contextual animations
5. IF the user has reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences and disable animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want consistent visual elements to maintain their position during transitions, so that the interface feels stable and connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the header SHALL maintain visual continuity with a smooth transition
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the footer SHALL maintain visual continuity with a smooth transition
3. WHEN navigating between blog posts THEN shared elements like navigation SHALL transition smoothly
4. WHEN the main content changes THEN it SHALL animate in a way that clearly indicates the content change
5. WHEN transitioning between pages with similar layouts THEN shared UI elements SHALL maintain their visual connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want theme changes to transition smoothly without interfering with page navigation, so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changing themes THEN the color transition SHALL be smooth and not jarring
2. WHEN changing themes during a page transition THEN both transitions SHALL work harmoniously without conflict
3. WHEN the system theme preference changes THEN the transition SHALL be subtle and non-disruptive
4. IF a page transition is in progress THEN theme changes SHALL queue appropriately to avoid conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor using the blog section, I want article list interactions to feel responsive and connected, so that browsing content feels engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading more articles THEN new articles SHALL animate into view smoothly
2. WHEN clicking on an article link THEN the transition SHALL provide visual connection between the list item and the article page
3. WHEN returning to the article list from an article THEN the system SHALL restore the previous scroll position with a smooth transition
4. WHEN the article list updates THEN existing articles SHALL maintain their positions while new ones animate in

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor on mobile devices, I want transitions that feel native and responsive, so that the web app feels like a quality mobile application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using touch gestures for navigation THEN transitions SHALL feel responsive and immediate
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN transitions SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN using the site as a PWA THEN transitions SHALL feel native and app-like
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN transitions SHALL gracefully handle loading states
5. IF the device has limited performance THEN transitions SHALL be optimized to maintain smooth frame rates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable and extensible view transition system, so that new pages and components can easily integrate smooth transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new pages THEN they SHALL automatically inherit appropriate default transitions
2. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL have clear patterns for adding custom transitions
3. WHEN debugging transition issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and fallbacks
4. WHEN browser support is limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to no transitions
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL have mechanisms to disable or simplify transitions
