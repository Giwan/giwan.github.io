- [x] 6. Enhance CSS with contextual directional animations
  - Extend global.css with directional transition animations (forward/backward)
  - Add CSS custom properties for page-type specific transitions

  - Create scale, fade, and crossfade transitions for different page relationships
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 7. Add transition:name to article list items
  - Update ArticlesContainer.astro to add transition:name to article list items
  - Implement staggered animations for article loading using CSS animation-delay
  - Create visual connection between list items and detail pages
  - Enhance existing scroll position restoration with smooth transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Implement mobile and PWA transition optimizations
  - Add responsive CSS custom properties for mobile-optimized transition timing
  - Create device orientation change handling with Astro transition events
  - Implement PWA-specific transition behaviors using service worker integration
  - Add network condition awareness using navigator.connection API
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Add performance monitoring and fallbacks
  - Hook into Astro's transition events for performance metrics collection
  - Implement automatic transition simplification using CSS media queries
  - Add frame rate monitoring during astro:after-swap events
  - Create user preference controls for transition intensity
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 6.3, 6.5_

- [x] 10. Enhance accessibility features
  - Extend existing reduced motion CSS with comprehensive preference handling
  - Add screen reader announcements using Astro's client-side navigation events
  - Create keyboard navigation support with focus management
  - Implement transition:name for accessibility landmarks and skip links
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 5.5_

- [x] 11. Create comprehensive error handling
  - Implement graceful degradation when View Transition API is unsupported
  - Add error handling for Astro's astro:before-preparation failures
  - Create fallback mechanisms using Astro's built-in transition system
  - Add transition debugging tools for development mode
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 12. Integrate enhanced system with existing components
  - Update PageLayout.astro to include TransitionController initialization
  - Add transition:name attributes to navigation elements in HeaderNav
  - Integrate TransitionRegistry with Astro's client-side routing
  - Update ThemeToggle component to coordinate with page transitions
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 13. Add comprehensive testing suite
