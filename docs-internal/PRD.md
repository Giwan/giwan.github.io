# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Personal Tech Blog

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a personal technology blog. The project is a modern, performant, and statically-generated website built with Astro, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed via GitHub Actions. It serves as a platform for publishing technical articles, sharing knowledge, and showcasing personal projects.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To create a fast, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing personal blog for sharing technical content.
*   **Secondary Goal:** To serve as a personal portfolio and a playground for experimenting with modern web technologies.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   Ensure excellent performance with fast page loads (leveraging Astro's static generation).
    *   Provide a clean, readable, and responsive user interface.
    *   Enable easy content creation and management through Markdown files.
    *   Automate deployment to ensure seamless updates.
    *   Incorporate modern web features like PWA capabilities and a dark/light theme.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Fellow software developers and tech enthusiasts.
*   Potential employers or collaborators.
*   Readers interested in specific technologies covered in the blog posts (e.g., React, Astro, JavaScript, CSS).

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Core Blog Features
*   **Blog Index Page:** A paginated list of all published blog posts, showing title, publication date, and a brief excerpt.
*   **Individual Blog Post Pages:** Cleanly formatted pages for each article, rendered from Markdown.
*   **Content Management:** Blog posts are managed as individual Markdown files within the `src/content/blog/` directory.
*   **RSS Feed:** An automatically generated `rss.xml` file for content syndication.

### 4.2. User Interface & Experience
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout must adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between a light and dark theme, and their preference is persisted.
*   **Navigation:** A clear and consistent navigation header linking to key pages (Home, About, Contact).
*   **Search:** A client-side search functionality to filter blog posts by title and content. Search index is pre-built at build time.

### 4.3. Technical Features
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** The entire site is pre-built into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and security.
*   **PWA (Progressive Web App):** The site is installable and provides a basic offline experience through a service worker. Includes a `manifest.json` and necessary icons.
*   **SEO:** The site is optimized for search engines with proper meta tags, a `robots.txt` file, and a sitemap (implicitly via RSS).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Achieve a high Google Lighthouse score, particularly for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy to update.
*   **Deployment:** The site must be automatically deployed to a hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Deno Deploy) upon pushing changes to the main branch.

## 6. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Astro
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Language:** TypeScript, JavaScript
*   **Content:** Markdown
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Actions
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## 7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for v1)

*   **Advanced Search:** Integration with a third-party search provider like Algolia.
*   **Comment System:** Adding a comments section to blog posts (e.g., Giscus, Disqus).
*   **Tagging/Categorization:** Ability to tag posts and filter by tags.
*   **Analytics:** Integration with a privacy-focused analytics tool.
