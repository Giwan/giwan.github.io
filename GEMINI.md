## Gemini-Specific Directives

- **Context Awareness**: Always prioritize the architectural decisions
  documented in `agent-docs/context.md`.
- **Formatting**: Ensure all shell commands are clearly fenced and include
  necessary context (e.g., current directory).
- **Proactivity**: If a task requires verification, proactively run
  `npm run build` or `npm run test` as outlined in `agent-docs/protocol.md`.
