There are times when just a fairly simple task needs to be completed.
Typing this into a search engine can lead down a mad rabbit hole of filler blog content amount to nothing.
This is also a blog but I'm hoping to keep it to the point.

## [ProductHunt.com](https://producthunt.com)

ProductHunt is quite generic in the tools that are available there.
Still the site hosts quite a few tools that are of value.
The search is quite decent and new tools are readily _hunted_ there.

## [Tiny-helpers.dev](https://tiny-helpers.dev/)

A collection of single purpose tools for developers. Think Favicon or image icons for a PWA site.
At the time of writing there are 502 tools on the site.
This is not as much as compared to say ProductHunt but still a decent collection.
