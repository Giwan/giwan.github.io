Create a project with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">Create-React-App</a> and <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank">jest</a> is already included.
Coverage however, which indicates how much of the code has been **covered** by tests, is not on by default.
Ideally each part of code is covered by tests. Coverage ensures that.
Completely bug free software is not possible even with 100% test coverage.
The tests themselves can have bugs after all. Full test coverage does provide a higher level of confidence in the code.

## New project with default JestJS setup

Create a new project using Create-React-App.
Navigate into the folder and run the test.

```shell
npx create-react-app my-test-project
cd my-test-project

# run tests with out coverage
npm run test
```

## Coverage

With the default tests passing, the next step is to check how much of the code was covered.
Add the following to `package.json`.

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "test:coverage": "CI=true npm test -- --coverage --color"
}
```

### Continuous integration

By setting CI to true, the test is prevented from going into watch mode.

### NPM test

Since the test script has already been defined, it's reused in the `test:coverage` script.
The `--coverage --color` flag shows the coverage report in colour.

# Bonus: Bitbucket pipeline

If the project is using BitBucket pipelines, this is how it can be configured to run the test before the deployment.

```yaml
# build pipeline

image: node:13.7.0

pipelines:
    branches:
        master:
            - step:
                  name: Build and test
                  script:
                      - CI=true npm cit
```

## `NPM cit`

This cleans the `node_modules` folder, installs the dependencies and runs the test.
