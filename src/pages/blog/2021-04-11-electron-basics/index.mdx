ElectronJS is a common choice for desktop applications.
Among others , the popular VSCode and Slack desktop apps have been created with it.

## Risks

If not managed well an ElectronJS application can **expose the entire system**.
This project will also address these and explain how to mitigate them.

## Project setup

In the projects directory, create a new folder named `electron-snowpack-basic`.
In the newly created directory run `npm init -y` to initialise the project with a default **yes**.
The folder now has a `package.json`.

### Add Electron to package.json

```bash
# add electron
npm i --save-dev electron
```

Start electron now with `electron .` and it will look for a `index.js` by default.
Change the default to `main` in `package.json`.
It's not strictly necessary but helps keep things organised.

```json
// package.json
// ...
"main": "main.js",
```

### The starting electron file

Create a `main.js` file in the root folder.
The main file is where a new browser window is created.

```js
// main.js
// When started, electron will start with this file.

const { BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
const path = require("path");

/**
 * Create main electron window
 */
function createWindow() {
    const win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        title: "Editoory",
        webPreferences: {
            contextIsolation: true,
            preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
        },
    });

    win.loadFile("index.html");
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow);
```

The `BrowserWindow` object is imported from `electron`.
With it a new window is created with a the given sizes.

the `webPreferences` object is important for security.
Exposure is limited by setting `contextIsolation` to `true`.
The `preload` file helps to channel information between the **insecure** browser window and the electron app that has access to NodeJS.

To avoid a reference error, create the `preload.js` file with `touch preload.js`.
For the moment it does not need any content.

Also create a basic `index.html` file and add the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Electron basics</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

This is the content that will be rendered in the newly created `browserWindow`.

Add this `start` script to the `package.json` file.
`start: "electron ."`

Now the application can be started with `npm start`.
The electron app should now start and show the contents of`index.html`.

---

# React with snowpack

The next part is to use React with Snowpack.
Currently the electron app renders the vanilla `index.html`.
To use react, it's embedded in the html file.

Start by installing `snowpack`, `concurrently` and `wait-on`. with `npm i --save-dev snowpack concurrently wait-on`.
Concurrently will ensure that both the electron process as the react process run _concurrently_.
With `wait-on`, the react process is ready before starting electron.
Otherwise the window will need to be reloaded to see the react rendered page the first time.

The `package.json` scripts can now be adapted to use these.

```json

"start": "concurrently 'npm run snowpack-dev' 'wait-on http://localhost:8080 && npm run electron-start'",
"snowpack-dev": "snowpack dev --open none --polyfill-node",
"electron-start": "electron .",

```

The start script uses `concurrently` to run two other npm scripts.
`snowpack-dev` starts snowpack. `--open-none` prevents snowpack from opening a new browser window.

`--polyfill-node` is necessary to enable the communication between the renderer (React/JavaScript) and the main Electron process.

Next the React script is added to the html file.
Add the following to `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/src/index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

This references the `/src/` directory that will be created in the build output directory.
The build directory is automatically created by Snowpack when running the build command below.

Snowpack looks for the `.jsx` extension to recognise the files it should treat as React.
Create a `src` folder. It separates the React code from the the Electron.

### The ReactJS content

Start by creating `index.jsx` in the src directory.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

The `react` and `react-dom` packages are required.

```bash
# install react and react-dom
npm i --save-dev react react-dom
```

### Build script

Add a new entry to `package.json` `scripts` object.
The snowpack build command builds the react files allowing electron to access them as regular JavaScript.
The following are a few script commands to facilitate building in different environments.

```json

"snowpack-prepare": "snowpack install",
"build": "npm run snowpack-build",
"snowpack-build": "snowpack build"

```

The `package.json` script object should now look like this:

```json


    "start": "concurrently 'npm run snowpack-dev' 'wait-on http://localhost:8080 && npm run electron-start'",
    "build": "npm run snowpack-build",
    "electron-start": "electron .",
    "electron-prod": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production electron .",
    "snowpack-dev": "snowpack dev --open none --polyfill-node",
    "snowpack-prepare": "snowpack install",
    "snowpack-build": "snowpack build"

```

While developing a `snowpack dev` will run a local server which provides valuable tools like hot module reloading.
In production mode only the final HTML and JS files will need to be referenced.

The `main.js` file will also need to be updated to handle two different context that the application can be in:

```js
//  main.js

const { BrowserWindow, app } = require("electron");
const path = require("path");

function createWindow() {
    const win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        title: "Editoory",
        webPreferences: {
            contextIsolation: true,
            preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
        },
    });

    process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
        ? win.loadFile("./build/index.html")
        : win.loadURL("http://localhost:8080");
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow);
```

The process is checked `NODE_ENV`. In **production** the final `build/index.html` can be loaded.
Any other mode reads from the local development server.

Start the electron application with `npm start`

A follow-up article will discuss how to send data to the main electron process to securely access the file system.
