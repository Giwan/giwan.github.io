Windows 11 was launched with promises of a fresh design and improved
productivity. However, as ColdFusion explores in his recent video, the operating
system helps highlight a growing crisis in the PC ecosystem—one defined by
planned obsolescence, forced adoption, and aggressive data gathering.

## The Hardware Wall

One of the most controversial aspects of Windows 11 is its strict hardware
compatibility list.

- **TPM 2.0 Requirement**: Millions of perfectly capable secure PCs were
  instantly deemed "obsolete" because they lacked this specific security chip.
- **CPU Gating**: Even powerful processors from just a few years ago (like many
  7th Gen Intel chips) are unsupported.

This decision creates a massive e-waste problem. As support for Windows 10 winds
down, we face a scenario where millions of functional computers will be
discarded simply because they don't meet an arbitrary cutoff, despite having the
raw power to run the OS perfectly fine.

## The "Subscription" Feel

While Windows itself isn't technically a monthly subscription (yet), the service
model is shifting.

- **Rapid EOL Cycles**: Versions like 23H2 have seemingly short support windows
  (2 years for Home/Pro), forcing users onto a treadmill of constant upgrades.
- **OS as a Service Platform**: The operating system feels less like a tool you
  own and more like a platform to serve you ads for OneDrive, Game Pass, and
  Microsoft 365.

## Aggressive AI Integration

Microsoft is betting the farm on AI, and Windows 11 is the vehicle.

- **Copilot**: It's being integrated into every corner of the OS, often without
  a clear way to disable it completely.
- **User Data**: Training AI requires data, and there are valid concerns about
  how deeply these "assistants" are monitoring user activity to provide their
  features. The push feels less about user benefit and more about shareholder
  value.

## The User Experience

Beyond the existential issues, the day-to-day experience is suffering from
"feature creep" and nagging.

- **Default Browser Wars**: Trying to change your default browser from Edge is
  harder than it needs to be, with Windows constantly pleading with you to
  switch back.
- **Start Menu Ads**: "Recommended" apps that are essentially advertisements
  clutter the interface.

## Conclusion

The "Crisis" isn't just about bugs or a new UI; it's about a fundamental shift
in the relationship between the user and their computer. Windows 11 signals a
future where the user has less control, the hardware lifespan is artificially
shortened, and the OS exists primarily to funnel users into an ecosystem of
services.

For many, this is the tipping point to finally explore alternatives like Linux
or macOS.
