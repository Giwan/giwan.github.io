## Why VueJS

I was sort of forced to use <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VueJS</a> so it seemed like a good time to dive into it a bit.
It is often mentioned as an alternative for React.

## Vue component structure

A typical Vue component consists of a `<template>` section, followed by a `<script>` section and then closing with a `<style>` section.
These three areas can be seen here in a list component. Note that the filename is `ItemsList.vue`.

```js

// src/components/ItemsList.vue

<template>
    <main>
        <section v-for="planet in planets" :key="planet.name">
            <header @click="selectPlanet(planet)">
                <img :src="planet.image" width="100" :alt="planet.name" />
                <h1>{{ planet.name }}</h1>
            </header>
        </section>
    </main>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    name: "ItemsList",
    props: {
        msg: String,
        planets: Array,
        selectPlanet: Function
    }
};
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style scoped>
main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    color: white;
}

h3 {
    margin: 40px 0 0;
}
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
}
li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 10px;
}
a {
    color: #42b983;
}
</style>


```

It receives an array of planets to be listed via `props`.
The `App` component in the root of the folder,
loads the planet data and then passes it to the list component.

```js

// src/App.vue

<template>
    <div>
        <ItemsList
            msg="message from parent"
            :planets="planets"
            :selectPlanet="this.selectPlanet"
        />
        <PlanetDetail
            v-if="selectedPlanet"
            :selectedPlanet="this.selectedPlanet"
            :close="this.selectPlanet"
        />
    </div>
</template>

<script>
import ItemsList from "./components/ItemsList";
import PlanetDetail from "./components/PlanetDetail";
import { loadData } from "./data/data";

export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
        ItemsList,
        PlanetDetail
    },
    created() {
        this.loadData();
    },
    methods: {
        loadData,
        selectPlanet: function(planet) {
            this.selectedPlanet = planet;
        }
    },
    data: function() {
        return {
            planets: [],
            selectedPlanet: undefined
        };
    }
};
</script>

<style>
#app {
    font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
    text-align: center;
    color: #2c3e50;
    margin-top: 60px;
}

body {
    background-color: black;
}
</style>


```

The `script -> methods` section defines the `loadData` method inside the component.
It is imported on line 19 with `import { loadData } from "./data/data";`
That however **does not execute** the method. Execution happens in the `created` section.

```js


created() {
    this.loadData();
}
```

When loadData is called, it retrieves the data from `/data.json`.
`this.planets` gets updated directly in that export which is not great.
Still as this is a demo I'll leave it at that.

```js
export const loadData = async function () {
    const resp = await fetch("/data.json");

    if (!resp.ok) {
        throw new Error("failed to get json data");
    }

    this.planets = await resp.json();
};
```

In a future update, I'd return the data and then set `this.planets` in the component where this method was called.
That avoids confusing any future devs as to the context of `this`.

## ItemsList

The `App.vue` component loads two custom components.
The `ItemList` component is passed the planets data.
With that data it shows a list of the planets.

```js

<ItemsList
    msg="message from parent"
    :planets="planets"
    :selectPlanet="this.selectPlanet"
/>

```

The planets is passed to the `ItemsList` child component with this.
`:planets="planets"` In this case the planets value that seems to be between strings is actually read as code in Vue.

With `:selectPlanet="this.selectPlanet"` the child component can call the method `this.selectPlanet` which exists in the parent.
Line 32.
