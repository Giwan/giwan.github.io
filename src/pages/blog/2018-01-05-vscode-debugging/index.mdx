Before getting started, you'll need to install the `debugger for Chrome` extension

In the debug view click on the cog wheel in the top left to have VSCode automatically load up the `launch.json` file.

```json
{
    "name": "run localhost:3000",
    "type": "chrome",
    "request": "launch",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
}
```

| Key       | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | _The name of the task shown next to the play button (top left)_                                                   |
| `Type`    | _What type of process are you running. (**Node \| Chrome**)_                                                      |
| `Request` | _Should it attach to an existing session or create a new one_                                                     |
| `webRoot` | _Points to the source files or say the build files. I.e._ `${workspaceFolder}/build` or `${workspaceFolder}/dist` |

Start the front-end from the terminal and leave it running. Press the play button in the debug menu. A new chrome session will be started.
Set a breakpoint in VSCode by clicking to the left of the line number. The breakpoint is indicated with a red dot.
Now run the front-end normally and the execution should stop at the breakpoint.

## Attaching to a running process

This does require chrome to be started with remote debugging enabled:
`$> /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`

```json
{
    "name": "Attach",
    "type": "chrome",
    "request": "attach",
    "port": 9222,
    "url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
}
```

# Conditional breakpoint

Now that it's possible to set break points directly in the editor, it would be nice to have some more control. Conditional breakpoints provide a conditional, which if true, will trigger the breakpoint.

Pro:
Pause execution directly in VSCode.

Con:
The source maps need to be setup correctly or you might get confusing output
