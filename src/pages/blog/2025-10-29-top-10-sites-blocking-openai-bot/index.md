OpenAI's GPTBot, a web crawler essential for training its AI models, is being
met with resistance. A growing number of major websites are opting to block the
bot, citing concerns over content scraping, data privacy, and the potential for
misuse of their information. This move signals a significant pushback from
content creators who wish to control how their data is utilized in the age of
generative AI. Here are some of the most prominent websites that have put up a
digital stop sign to OpenAI's bot.

### 1. The New York Times

A stalwart of journalism, The New York Times has blocked GPTBot to protect its
premium content from being used to train AI models without compensation.

### 2. Amazon

The e-commerce giant has blocked the bot, likely to safeguard its vast
repository of product descriptions, customer reviews, and proprietary sales
data.

### 3. Pinterest

This image-sharing platform is blocking GPTBot to prevent the scraping of its
extensive visual and user-generated content.

### 4. Indeed

A leading job search engine, Indeed is blocking the bot to protect its listings
and user data from being harvested.

### 5. USA Today

Another major American newspaper, USA Today is blocking the bot to prevent its
news articles from being used to train AI without permission.

### 6. Wired

Known for its in-depth tech journalism, Wired is blocking GPTBot to protect its
intellectual property and maintain control over its content.

### 7. Stack Exchange

A network of Q&A websites, Stack Exchange is blocking the bot to prevent the
scraping of its user-generated questions and answers.

### 8. WebMD

A popular source for medical information, WebMD is blocking GPTBot to protect

### 9. Quora

## European Companies Taking a Stand

The trend of blocking `GPTBot` is not limited to the US. Several major
European companies have also implemented measures to prevent OpenAI's crawler
from accessing their content.

### The Guardian (UK)

This prominent UK news organization has joined the ranks of media outlets
blocking GPTBot, emphasizing the need to control its journalistic content.

### MailOnline (UK)

The online platform for the Daily Mail, another major UK news outlet, is
blocking GPTBot to protect its content.

### BBC (UK)

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has blocked both of OpenAI's
crawlers, `GPTBot` and `ChatGPT-User`, to safeguard its extensive archive of
news and media content.

### OK Diario (Spain)

This Spanish news publication is one of the few major media outlets in Spain
to block `GPTBot`.

### BFM TV (France)

One of France's most-watched news channels, BFM TV, has also blocked
OpenAI's web crawler.

## The Dutch Perspective

While many large companies across Europe are blocking `GPTBot`, the trend
does not appear to have gained the same traction in the Netherlands. At the
time of this writing, a review of the most popular Dutch websites, including
e-commerce giants like **Bol.com** and **ah.nl**, and news outlets like
**Buienradar**, shows that they are not currently blocking OpenAI's web
crawler. This may change as the global conversation around AI and data
privacy continues to evolve.

### Conclusion

The decision by these and other major websites to block OpenAI's GPTBot
highlights a growing tension between AI developers and content creators. As AI
continues to evolve, the debate over data ownership and fair use will
undoubtedly intensify. The actions of these digital giants may pave the way for
new standards and practices in the ethical sourcing of data for AI training.
