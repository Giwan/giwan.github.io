Rollup [rollupjs.org](https://rollupjs.org) makes it easy to bundle the library code into different bundle types.

## Why different bundles?

The code will be packaged as:

-   [CommonJS (CJS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS)
-   [ECMA Script Modules (ESM)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)
-   [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)

These each have different use cases depending on the developer looking to use this library.

### Common JS

CommonJS is typically used on the server, think NodeJS App using the `require()` syntax.

### ECMA Script modules

These are often imported in a client side app. Example: a ReactJS app created with for example `create-react-app`.
The library can easily be imported using the `import test from "test"` syntax.

### Universal Module definition

Here the typical usecase is a plain website that uses the `<script src="test"></script>` syntax.
Bundling for UMD typically also needs a name value. The library is accessible through a global object.
Example: `window.test` if "test" was the name provided when bundling.

# Getting started

Create a new empty folder where the project will live. Inside it create the folders **src** and **dist**.
Raw dev code is stored in **src** while the compiled bundles live in **dist**.

### NPM init

Initialise the project with the following:

```shell
# initialise the npm project
npm init -y
```

The `y` flag forces the default answer to all the NPM questions.
The name property will use the name of the project folder.
I'll use "test-component" for mine.

### Installing Rollup

Rollup is a development dependency. It isn't bundled with the production code.

```sh
# Install Rollup as a development dependency
npm i -D rollup
```

The following configuration file helps us to specify where the bundles will be stored.
For the UMD bundle a `name` property is required.
In this case `react` and `react-dom` are listed as dependencies.
These will be used in a follow-up article where the component is converted into a ReactJS component.

```js
// rollup.config.js

import resolve from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve";
import { babel } from "@rollup/plugin-babel";
import autoprefixer from "autoprefixer";
import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss";

const dist = "dist"; // output folder

export default {
    input: "src/main.js",
    external: ["react", "react-dom"], // specify external dependencies

    // Define the output bundles that will be created.
    // Each array entry is a bundle.
    output: [
        {
            file: `${dist}/bundle.cjs.js`,
            format: "cjs", // CommonJS
            exports: "auto", // How to handle exports (details below)
        },
        {
            file: `${dist}/bundle.umd.js`,
            format: "umd", // Universal Module Definition
            name: "reactRollup", // The name that will be used to attach it to the global object
            exports: "auto",
            globals: {
                react: "React",
            },
        },
        {
            file: `${dist}/bundle.esm.js`, // ECMAScript Module
            format: "esm",
            exports: "auto",
        },
    ],
    plugins: [
        resolve(), // find in node_modules
        babel({ exclude: "node_modules/**", babelHelpers: "bundled" }), // convert new JS syntax to ES5.
        postcss({
            plugins: [autoprefixer()],
            extract: false,
            modules: true,
        }),
    ],
    external: ["react", "react-dom"], // Specify external dependencies.
};
```

### Link the generated bundles in the `package.json`

Modify the `package.json` and add these three properties.

```json
// /package.json
{
    ...,
    "main": "dist/bundle.cjs.js",
    "browser": "dist/bundle.esm.js",
    "module": "dist/bundle.umd.js",
}

```

NPM always requires the main property. It is pointing to the location of the generated `CommonJS` file.
The `browser` property indicates where the ECMAScript module can be found.
Last is the `module` pointing to it's corresponding file.
This will allow anyone to use our library from https://unpkg.com/

At the beginning of the configuration file certain packages are imported.
Those need to be installed, along with a few other supporting packages.
Run the following command to install them as development dependencies.

```sh
# run in root directory

npm i -D @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-babel autoprefixer rollup-plugin-postcss @babel/core postcss
```

`exports: "auto"` controls how the export statement in a module is handled.
More information on `exports: "auto"` here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-commonjs

### Create a simple `main.js` file

Testing the setup requires a few more steps. First a `main.js` file is need.
A simple one will do for now.

```js
// src/main.js

const testFunction = function () {
    console.log("this is a simple test function");
};

export default testFunction;
```

Add the following script to the `package.json`

```js
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c",
}

```

With the `package.json` saved, execute the script.

```sh
# run build
npm run build

```

This creates the three bundles in the dist directory.
Open each of them to the code that was generated there.

## Testing the component

Since the function is very simple, only a simple test setup will be done for now.
Create an example folder in the root directory and add the file `server.js`.

```shell
# Create an examples folder
mkdir -p examples/server

# Create a file in it called server.js
touch examples/server/server.js
```

Using NodeJS we can execute `server.js`.
It will import and use our library component thereby proving that it's working as expected.
This example/server directory is effectively a project within our parent project.

We'll need to init npm here to.

```shell
# initialise NPM in the example/server folder

cd examples/server # move into the examples/server older
npm init -y

```

That will provide a new `package.json` file.
In it add the start script:

```json

// examples/server/package.json

{
    ...,
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node ./server.js",
    },
    ...
}
```

Running the script now will not do anything since there is nothing in the `server.js` file.
Let's add a simple `console.log` statement to ensure all is well.

```js
// examples/server/server.js

console.log("This is the server.js file saying hello");
```

While still in the examples/server/ folder, save the file and run it.

```sh
# examples/server/
# Save the changes to the server.js file and start it

npm start
```

The log statement shows up directly in the console.
Now we'll need to import our library component.

## Importing our library component

While still in `/examples/server` install the following:

```sh
# /examples/server/

npm i ../../../test-component # The name of the directory that the root project is in
```

Now that the component has been installed, it can be imported in `server.js` and used.

```js
// /examples/server/server.js

const testFunction = require("test-component");
testFunction();
console.log("This is the server.js file saying hello");
```

Run the start command again in the examples folder.

```shell
# /examples/server
npm start
```

There should be two console log statements in the terminal.
