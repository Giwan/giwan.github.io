## Moving from Gatsby to NextJS

I started using MDX to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> pages with JS components in them.
This should allow the combination of both worlds. Markdown texts alongside active JSX components.
This post is about moving away from Gatsby which uses GraphQL under the hood.
It's very much overkill for a blog like this.

This setup is based on the awesome article from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/build-blog-nextjs-mdx/" target="_blank">Ibrahima Ndaw on Smashing Magazine</a>.

## Create a new React project

```bash
# Create a new project
npx create-next-app
```

## Add the MDX loaders

The blog articles will be written in MDX.
The following loaders will read and parse `MDX` files to `HTML`.

```bash
# Install loaders
npm i @mdx-js/loader @next/mdx
```

Now that loaders have been installed, they need to be configured.

## Configure `next.config.js` to pick up the MDX files

In `next.config.js` the following configuration ensures that the `MDX` files are read from the pages directory.
Note that other file extensions will also be read.

```js
// next.config.js

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [],
    },
});

module.exports = {
    ...withMDX({
        pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
    }),
    target: "serverless",
};
```

Create the page `test.mdx` in the pages directory. It's now possible to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test`.
That route should now exist.

## Read `/pages/blog/[]/index.mdx` as blog post

All of the blogs will reside in `/pages/blog/`. There a folder is created with an `index.mdx`.
Any other files relevant to the post can also be added there.

In the root of the project create `getAllPosts.js`.

```js
// getAllPosts.js

/**
 * For each file in the directory, get the filename
 * and remove the string "index.mdx"
 * @param {*} r
 */
function importAll(r) {
    return r.keys().map((fileName) => ({
        link: fileName.substr(1).replace(/\/index\.mdx$/, ""),
        module: r(fileName),
    }));
}

export const posts = importAll(
    require.context("./pages/blog/", true, /\.mdx$/)
);
```

It loops over the folders in the `/pages/blog` folder and uses those to register them as pages.
That makes `http://localhost:3000/blog/article-name` available.

## A Layout component

All the content will be wrapped by the following `Layout` component.
It renders the meta header tags with `next/head`.
The website `header` and it's `main` content follows that.

```js
// /components/Layout.js

import Head from "next/head";
import Header from "./Header/Header";
import styles from "./main.module.css";

const Layout = ({ children, pageTitle, description }) => (
    <>
        <Head>
            <meta
                name="viewport"
                content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
            />
            <meta charSet="utf-8" />
            <meta name="Description" content={description}></meta>
            <title>{pageTitle}</title>
        </Head>
        <Header />
        <main className={styles.mainContent}>{children}</main>
    </>
);

export default Layout;
```

## The article preview in `Post.js` component

The next component required is `ArticleItem.js`.
It will render the article's preview on the listing page.
The component receives a `post` object which contains a `link` property and
a `module` property which contains the post's meta data.

```js
// /components/ArticleItem.js

import Link from "next/link";
import ArticleHeader from "./Article/ArticleHeader";

const ArticleItem = ({
    post: {
        link,
        module: { meta },
    },
}) => (
    <article>
        <ArticleHeader meta={meta} />
        <Link href={"/blog" + link}>
            <a>Read more â†’</a>
        </Link>
    </article>
);

export default ArticleItem;
```

## The entire article in `Article.js`

The entire article is displayed with `Article.js` in `/components/Article`.
It also receives the post data which contains the `children` and `meta`.

```js
// /components/Article/Article.js

import ArticleHeader from "./ArticleHeader";
import styles from "./article.module.css";

const Article = ({ children, meta }) => (
    <div className={styles.article}>
        <ArticleHeader meta={meta} isBlogPost />
        <article>{children}</article>
    </div>
);

export default Article;
```

## Write a blog post in MDX

Add an article in `/pages/blog/`. In this example it's called `example`.

```js

// /pages/blog/example/index.mdx

---
description: `some long description
with multiple lines
`

    title: "example title",

    createDate: "01-01-2021",
    publishedDate: "01-01-2021",
    readTime: 2
layout: "../../../layouts/BlogArticle.astro",
---



## Example secondary title
Some text in the article
```

## Show posts list on the index page

The following code lists all of the posts that it finds in the `blog` folder.
These can then be shown on the listing page.

```js
// pages/index.js

import ArticleItem from "../components/ArticleItem/ArticleItem";
import { posts } from "../getAllPosts";
import styles from "./index.module.css";

const publishedPosts = (posts = []) =>
    posts.filter((p) => !!p.module.meta.published);

export default function IndexPage() {
    return (
        <div className={styles.articleListContainer}>
            {publishedPosts(posts).map((post) => (
                <ArticleItem key={post.link} post={post} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}
```

The `ArticleItem` component is used to render the posts data based on what has been received from `getAllPosts`.

## use \_app.js to wrap the content

Create `/pages/_app.js`. The `_` tells `NextJS` that this file should **not** be a route.
`NextJS` also recognises `app.js` as an initializer. Here global imports, like `global.css` can be imported.

```js
// /pages/_app.js

import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import "../node_modules/prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css";
import "../styles/globals.css";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return (
        <Layout pageTitle="Mytoori Blog" description="Mytoori Blog">
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Layout>
    );
}
```

## MDX code styling (Installation & configuration)

The code should be properly styled for readability. That allows the reader to quickly scan and find the info that is right for her.

```js
// code styling example: JS keywords are coloured

const exampleFunctionToDemonstrateCodeStyling = () => {
    const thisIsADemoValue = 1 + 1;
    return thisIsADemoValue;
};
```

For the styling to work, essentially the code text block is split into HTML nodes. Those nodes can now have a colour applied to them individually.

### Install the Rehype-prism package

Styling the code is done by [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism).
It's a plugin for [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) and performs the highlighting.

```bash
# Install @mapbox/rehype-prism.
npm i @mapbox/rehype-prism
```

### Configure `next.config.js` to use rehype-prism

`next.config.js` exports a configuration object that is read by Next. In that configuration file the plugin is added to `next/mdx`.

```js
// import the rehype-prism
const rehypePrism = require("@mapbox/rehype-prism");

// Add the imported component to rehype
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
    },
});

// Export a configuration object (which is used by next)
module.exports = {
    ...withMDX({
        pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
    }),
    target: "serverless",
};
```

Any `code` component in the MDX file will now be wrapped in an HTML element. That allows CSS styling to be applied.
to do that the following styles are imported.

## Code styles from Prism

In `_app.js` the CSS styles are imported from the prism package. The previously installed `prism-okaidia.css` has prism as a dependency.
The CSS files in that package can be directly imported into the project.

Note: other styles are also possible.

```js
// /pages/_app.js

import "../node_modules/prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css";
```

## Development

Start the development server with the following.

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
