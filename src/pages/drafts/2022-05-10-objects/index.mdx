Everything in JavaScript is a an object. Functions are a special kind of object for example.
They are special properties which allows them to be treated as functions, meaning they can be executed.
However, it's possible to still treat functions as an object.

```js
function test() {
    console.log("this function does not do much");
}

// We can now add a property!!

test.someRandomProperty = 3;

test(); // output: "this function does not do much"
test.someRandomProperty; // output: 3.
```

This helps solidify the knowledge that everything in JavaScript is an object.
