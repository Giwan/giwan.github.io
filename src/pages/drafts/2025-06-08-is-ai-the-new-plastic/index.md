We all know plast. While that might sound like a negative ding at AI, it's not.
There are still good and important uses of plastics. I doubt that we want go
back to a world without plastics. Of course there's still the overuse of
plastics. This is why I think it might be such a good analogy, right down to the
"cheapness" feeling that plastics give us compared to non-plastic alternatives.

## Lets start with what you're all thinking

The content that AI produces is often of low quality, i.e. cheap plastic. The
content can be shallow and feel like regurgitation. Some of it is even
dangerously wrong.

Then there is the plagiarism issue. AI can be used to generate content that is
dangerously close to existing content. I'll stay out of that debate for now.

## Good uses of plastics

Plastics are used for many things that we need. From medical equipment to
plastic bags. The latter might not be great as there are many alternatives.
However for medical equipment it's hard to find alternatives.

I suspect that similarly AI can indeed help address many of the issues we face
today. Yes that might shake up the job market. While that can be uncomfortable
on a larger scale it could in theory benefit us.

That does depend on how it's used though. That again is similar to plastics.
